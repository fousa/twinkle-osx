{"name":"Twinkle","tagline":"Make your Blink(1) change color on application change","body":"### Blink(1)\r\n\r\nI bought the Blink(1) device on a [Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thingm/blink1-the-usb-rgb-led). I hope to do more cool stuff with it!\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\n\r\nEvery time you change the focus to another application you Blink(1) device will change to the color you set in the preference panel.\r\n\r\n### Change the settings\r\n\r\nYou can start listening to an application by selecting the application in the list and selecting the  Active checkbox. The color that is set will be the color of the Blink(1) device when you switch to the selected application.\r\n\r\n### By who?\r\n\r\nWell, I (@fousa on the Github) created the application so I could play around with the Blink(1) device and it's interface.
